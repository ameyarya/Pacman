# Pacman
The pacman project is part of the Foundations of AI course that I took in the Fall 2019 semester.
It is based on the UC berkley course CS188 found at : http://ai.berkeley.edu/

The project is based on four main modules namely
### Search
### MultiAgent Search
### Reinforcement Learning
### Tracking
  
All the editable files has been done during the course and is solely my work
